### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Maersk-Global/FinBot.git
cd FinBot

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment

.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

Start the application using Streamlit.

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 5. Access the Application

Once the application starts, it will provide a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`) that you can open in your web browser to interact with the app.

### 6. Access via Terminal

If you prefer to interact with the application through the terminal, you can run the following command:

```bash
python cli.py
```

This will display the output directly in the terminal.
